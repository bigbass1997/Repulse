### Description
Twitch API wrapper library for Java.

### Building
Gradle is used as the dependency and build management software. Included in the repo is the Gradle Wrapper which allows you to run gradle commands from the root directory of the project. You can compile and run the program with `gradlew run`. To build the source into a runnable jar, execute `gradlew build`. The resulting jar will be found in `build/libs/*.jar`.

To generate project files for IDEA or Eclipse: `gradlew idea` and `gradlew eclipse` respectively. Your IDE may also have the ability to import Gradle projects.
